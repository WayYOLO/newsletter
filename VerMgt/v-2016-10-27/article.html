                                        <p>Welcome back to ZTEsoft newsletter October Issue.</p>
                                        <p>This September, delegates from 66+ countries gathered in Yinchuan and experienced in person how the innovative technologies make the city smarter and benefit the urban residents. The 2nd Smart City InFocus Event has once again represented that smart city enables a wonderful life. Enjoy the <b>VIDEO</b> to get the highlights at the event.</p>

                                        <p>Also outlined in this newsletter is the elaboration of well-thought, coherent ZSmart 8 BSS that delivers latest function and flexibility. See the <b>FEATURED SOLUTION</b> to get the details.</p>
                                        <p>We will also look at how to redefine the big data approach for telecom operators. The most critical question being discussed in the global market today is how much companies in the telecommunication industry can benefit from “big data”? All operators are searching for new ways to increase revenues and profits. However, only few have demonstrated the required capabilities to make the most of this new technology. In <b>INDUSTRY VISION</b> , the article explains a bottom-up approach to gather and extract the value of big data, and new roles of operators driven by big data.</p>
